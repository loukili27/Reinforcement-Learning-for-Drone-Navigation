# Reinforcement-Learning-for-Drone-Navigation
HackThis project is part of a hackathon challenge where participants develop a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent for autonomous drone navigation in a grid-based environment. The objective is to train drones to reach their targets efficiently while avoiding walls and dynamic obstacles.
